# TimelineTrouble

This is a Unity 2D Platformer that is created by a team of developers in a Game Programming course.

The premise of the game is using 3 characters controlled by a single control input (simultaneously). 

As of writing this (April 21st, 2018) the latest build is available at:

Avoid the obstalces, and reach all 3 players to the next level.
